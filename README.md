# markdown2gutenberg

This script purpose is to convert Markdown formatted files to HTML-compatible text, which then can be pasted into Wordpress Gutenberg editor.

If you prefer to write your posts in Markdown and when they are ready paste them to Wordpress, this code will be very helpful for you.

## Usage

The script is written in Python so you need to execute it using Python interpreter.

    python markdown2gutenberg.py <input_filename> [<output_filename>]

`input_filename` is the only required argument as the script needs a pointer to the Markdown file to process it, convert and save as `output_filename`.
